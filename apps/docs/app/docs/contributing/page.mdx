## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and ensure:
   - All tests pass
   - Code is properly formatted
   - Documentation is updated
   - Types are properly defined

3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

   We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks
   - `test:` for adding or modifying tests
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring

4. Push your changes and create a Pull Request

## Testing

We use Jest for testing. Run the test suite:

```bash
pnpm test          # Run all tests
pnpm test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
```

When adding new features, please include:
- Unit tests for new functionality
- Integration tests for API interactions
- Type tests to ensure type safety

## Documentation

When making changes, please update:
- TypeScript types and JSDoc comments
- README.md for significant changes
- Documentation pages in `/docs`
- Example code if relevant

## Type Safety

Next-TS-API prioritizes type safety. When contributing:

1. Use strict TypeScript settings
2. Avoid using `any` or `@ts-ignore`
3. Write proper type definitions
4. Test type inference and validation

## Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
pnpm lint        # Run linter
pnpm format      # Format code
```

Follow these guidelines:
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Use TypeScript features appropriately

## Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting a PR:

1. **Title**: Use conventional commits format
2. **Description**: Include:
   - Purpose of the change
   - Summary of the implementation
   - Any breaking changes
   - Screenshots for UI changes
3. **Changes**:
   - Keep changes focused and atomic
   - Include tests
   - Update documentation
4. **Review**:
   - Respond to review comments
   - Make requested changes
   - Keep the PR updated with the main branch
