# Next-TS-API Documentation

Welcome to the Next-TS-API documentation. Next-TS-API provides end-to-end type safety for your Next.js API routes, bridging the gap between Server Actions and API routes in your TypeScript applications.

## Overview

In Next.js 13+ applications, while Server Actions provide type safety for mutations, data fetching is often better handled through API routes for various reasons like caching, RESTful architecture, and third-party integrations. However, these API routes lack built-in type safety, creating a potential gap in your TypeScript application's type coverage.

Next-TS-API bridges this gap by providing:

- 🔒 **Full Type Safety** - Automatically generated TypeScript types for your API routes
- 🎯 **Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box with Next.js App Router
- 🔄 **Auto-completion** - Full IDE support for your API routes and methods
- 🛠️ **Type Inference** - Automatic inference of request/response types
